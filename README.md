# Psychosis identification from initial admission notes
## Step 1. Identifying Psychosis Episodes in Admission Notes: Rule-based Methods, Machine Learning, and Pre-Trained Language Models
### Abstract
**INTRODUCTION**\
Keyword-based searches and rule-based approaches are challenging to make use of identifying psychosis in admission notes. Inefficiencies could compromise treatment and early intervention. Our study investigates whether natural language processing via rule-based techniques, machine learning algorithms, and pre-trained language models (PLM) can improve admission note psychosis episode detection.

**MATERIALS AND METHODS**\
**_Study Settings and Data Curation_**: This approved McLean Hospital study examined 4,617 first mental admission notes from 2005 to 2019 (MGB Human Research Committee procedure). Psychiatrists examined each note for psychotic development. Identifying information was removed. The data were split into training/test sets by an 80:20 ratio. For non-rule-based models, the training set was further divided by an 80:20 ratio into training and validation sets.\
**_Study Design_**: Two rule-based methods were employed to identify patients with psychosis: ICD code assignment at discharge and keyword matching based on terms derived from electronic health records and clinical texts. The ICD codes were applied during discharge, while the keyword approach utilized terms exclusively from admission notes [1], which were carefully re-grouped by a weighing algorithm and reviewed by two psychiatrists (AS and LM) for our study. This step selected and categorized keywords into the strictly relevant group and the broadly relevant group for feature selection in building machine learning prediction models. More details can be found in Appendix A.
Four machine learning classifiers (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Multilayer Perceptron, and XGBoost) in conjunction with Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF) for feature extraction were implemented. TF-IDF was particularly valuable in emphasizing psychosis-indicative terms and reducing the significance of non-informative terms, which is especially advantageous in the mental health field. \
Finally, PLMs using BERT architecture given their wide adoption and lite weights, specifically Bio_ClinicalBERT and BlueBERT, were evaluated. 
Three sets of experiments were performed for machine learning algorithms—using all features from full admission notes (full), features extracted from notes with a broader keyword range (broad), and features extracted from notes with strictly relevant keywords (strict). Given the input length limit of 512 tokens, PLM experiments were conducted under broad and strict settings. Performance assessment included metrics like F1 score, sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, and area under the curve, supported by bootstrap resampling (n = 1,000) for confidence interval estimation.\

**RESULTS**\
Table 1 shows the results. Rule-based algorithms like ICD Code-based approaches performed well on medical admission notes, with F1 score of 0.761. Keyword-matching had restricted performance. Machine learning methods like XGBoost surpassed others across note subsets with the best F1 score of 0.8881, outperforming ICD code performance on discharge. BlueBERT and ClinicalBERT were proficient but did not outperform XGBoost in the F1 score. Both types of models performed differently when trained on all keywords or a base keyword collection, underscoring the relevance of feature selection.\

**DISCUSSION & CONCLUSION**\
Comparative studies are important in scientific research as they provide a systematic way to evaluate and contrast different methods or phenomena under similar conditions. In the context of psychosis episode detection, our study allows for the assessment of the relative effectiveness of various algorithms using admission notes. We found that machine learning methods, notably XGBoost, outperformed both rule-based and pre-trained language models in identifying psychosis episodes in admission notes, achieving the highest F1 score of 0.8881. It's worth noting that BlueBERT delivered competitive results, with an F1 score of 0.8841. 
performance, effectively reducing noise in the data. This observation highlights the importance of interpretable expert knowledge in building predictive models. To gain deeper insights, further investigation is required to conduct error analysis and assess the importance of features in the model. 
Through this study, we aim to provide future research with insights into the most efficient methods for detecting psychosis in clinical settings. This could lead to enhanced diagnostic processes and, ultimately, better patient outcomes.

### Appendix A
We adopted the keyword lists developed in a 2019 study by Viani, et al [1], which trained various models on use-case-specific EHR texts from early psychosis intervention services, institution-specific discharge summaries, and external clinical texts and also experimented with pre-trained embeddings from MEDLINE/PubMed. Their methodology encompassed diverse data sources, ensuring broad applicability and robustness in generating relevant terms, to develop an automated NLP model that could be applied to diverse settings outside of McLean Hospital. 
The paper presented three keyword sets: the foundational 26 base seed terms related to psychosis symptoms and two generated lists segmented into unigrams and bigrams. Each term from the generated lists was manually categorized as a Relevant Term (RT), a Potentially Relevant Term (PT), or Not Relevant (NT). Guided by this classification, we formulated two distinct rules, which we refer to as “strict” and “broad”, to construct our keyword lists from the combined unigram and bigram terms:
- Strict Rule: A term was considered strictly relevant only if it was unanimously identified as an RT by both annotators.
- Broad Rule: A term was deemed broadly relevant if either (1) one annotator marked the term as an RT while the other marked it as a PT or NT, or (2) both annotators agreed on marking the term as a PT.\
Following this, we integrated the terms filtered via these criteria with the original seed terms. 
During post-processing, underscores were substituted with spaces, and plural forms were streamlined. To further optimize for reducing computation complexity, both lists were refined to exclusively feature terms with the shortest unique substrings. We also removed the term “systematised delusional” and moved the term “persecutory” from broad to strict. Table 2 shows the final keyword lists.
